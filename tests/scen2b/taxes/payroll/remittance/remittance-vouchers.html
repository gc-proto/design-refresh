        <h2 id="gnrlnf">General information about statements of account and remittance vouchers</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Soon after you register, you will receive your first statement of account. You will generally receive another form after each remittance. The bottom part is a remittance voucher. If you remit electronically, you may receive <a href="#lctrncsttmnt">electronic statements</a> instead.</li>
 <li>Use only an <strong>original</strong> paper remittance voucher. Your financial institution can only process a form if it is <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/request-payment-forms-remittance-vouchers.html">specially printed</a> by the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</li>
 <li>If you do not have a remittance voucher, you <strong>must</strong> still remit on time. Go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/when-remit-source-deductions.html#HW">How to remit source deductions</a> for options.</li>
 <li>To avoid penalties and interest, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/when-remit-source-deductions.html#mprtntdts">Important information about due dates</a>.</li>
 <li>If you remit for more than one account, make sure you use the correct account’s voucher for each remittance.</li>
 <li>Keep an <strong>original</strong> paper remittance voucher handy in case electronic services are disrupted.</li>
 <li>If you receive a notice of assessment (<a href="#PD7D">Form PD7D</a>) that says you have a balance owing, only use&nbsp;the remittance form attached to the notice to make that payment. Similarly, do not use the current source deductions remittance voucher attached to your statement of account to pay this balance owing.</li>
 <li>Your statements of account are part of the payroll records you need to keep.</li>
 <li>If you still need more information about your statement of account or remittance voucher after you read the information below, call&nbsp;<span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong></span>.</li>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4><span>Remitting period</span></h4>
 <p>Your remitting period is the period during which you pay <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/overview-remitting-source-deductions.html#rmnrtn">remuneration</a>. This period may be different from your pay period.</p>  <p>Go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/when-remit-source-deductions.html#ddtssmmry">Summary of remittance due dates</a> for a table of remitting periods and due dates.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h4><span>Remitting period end date</span></h4>
 <p>Your <strong>remitting period end date</strong> is the last day of your remitting period. You will need to give this information when you remit.</p>  <p>For example, if you were regular remitter, your remitting period end date would be the last day of the month in which you <strong>paid</strong> the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/overview-remitting-source-deductions.html#rmnrtn">remuneration</a>. Another example would be if you were a threshold 2 accelerated remitter with a bi-weekly payroll, and you paid remuneration on the 8th and the 22nd of a month, then your remitting period end dates would be the 14th and last day of that month, respectively.</p>

        <h3 id="PD7RBbttm"><span>Bottom of Form PD7A-RB</span></h3>
<p><span></span>This part is your remittance voucher for when you send your deductions and contributions. If you remit at a financial institution, the teller will keep that part. Make sure your business’ legal name, address and account number are correct.</p>
<p>Fill out this remittance voucher as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the <a href="#Rmtprds">end of remitting period</a> for which you withheld deductions.</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>gross payroll in remitting period</strong>, rounded to the nearest dollar. This is all remuneration that you paid, before any deductions, such as income tax. It includes regular wages, commissions, overtime pay, paid leave, taxable benefits and allowances, piecework payments, and special payments. It is the same as the total of all amounts from the <a href="#Rmtprds">remitting period</a> that would appear in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/completing-filing-information-returns/t4-information-employers/t4-slip/filling-t4-slip.html#bx_14">box&nbsp;14, Employment income</a> on your employees' T4&nbsp;slips.</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>number of employees in latest pay period</strong>. Include any employee you will give a T4 slip to, such as part-time and temporary employees, and employees absent with pay. Do not include people you will not give a T4&nbsp;slip to. Do not include those you did not pay in the last pay period in the remitting period, such as employees on unpaid leave.</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>amount paid</strong>. This is the amount you are remitting. It should match your total <abbr title="Canada Pension Plan">CPP</abbr> and <abbr title="employment insurance">EI</abbr> (both employee and employer shares), plus the income tax you deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The back of your remittance voucher displays some reminders, the mailing address to use if you remit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/when-remit-source-deductions.html#ml">by mail</a>, and a box for a teller’s stamp if you remit at a financial institution.
