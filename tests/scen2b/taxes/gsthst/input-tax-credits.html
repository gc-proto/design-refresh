			<summary>Recapture of ITCs for large businesses&nbsp;</summary>
			<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



			<p>As a result of British Columbia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island harmonizing their provincial sales tax with the GST to implement the HST, as a temporary measure, <strong>large businesses</strong> have to recapture (repay) their ITCs for the provincial part of the HST paid or payable on specified property and services. Generally, you would be a large business during a given recapture period if your total revenue from annual taxable supplies is greater than $10 million in your last fiscal year that ended before a recapture period. Certain financial institutions would also be subject to these rules even if their revenue does not exceed the $10 million threshold.</p>
<p>Generally, you must report your recaptured ITCs in the reporting period in which the ITCs first became available. <strong>Failing to recapture ITCs as and when required could result in penalties.</strong></p>
<p>To simplify compliance, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4531.html">Form&nbsp;RC4531, Election or Revocation of an Election to Use the Estimation and Reconciliation Method to Report the Recapture of Input Tax&nbsp;Credits</a>,&nbsp;allows large businesses to estimate the amount of recaptured ITCs in their monthly or quarterly reporting periods and <strong>reconcile any differences</strong> between the amounts reported during the fiscal year and the actual amounts at fiscal year-end, using Schedule C, <em>Reconciliation of Recaptured Input Tax Credits (RITCs)</em>, <strong>within three months of the fiscal year-end</strong>.</p>
<p>For information on incorrectly reported recaptured ITCs, see&nbsp;<a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/gst-account/file-a-gst-hst-return/correct-a-gst-hst-return.html">Correct a&nbsp;GST/HST return</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on the recapture of ITCs, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/b-104.html">GST/HST Technical Information Bulletin B-104, Harmonized Sales Tax – Temporary Recapture of Input Tax Credits in Ontario and British Columbia</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-165.html">GST/HST Info Sheets GI-165, Prince Edward Island: Transition to the Harmonized Sales Tax&nbsp;– Builders and Recaptured Input Tax Credits</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-171.html">GI-171, Phasing out of Recaptured Input Tax Credits in Ontario</a>.</p>
