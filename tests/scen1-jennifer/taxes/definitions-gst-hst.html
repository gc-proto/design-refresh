Definitions for GST/HST</h1>




        <div><div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



        <h2><a name="addedproperty" id="addedproperty"></a>Added property</h2>
<p>The term added property refers to tangible personal property or software that is a component part or is property (such as a label or a screw) that is incorporated or combined with other property. Added property also includes packing materials used in packing other goods. With the use of a valid Export Distribution Centre certificate, a <a href="#registrant">registrant</a> is entitled to import, or acquire in Canada, property for use or supply as &quot;added property&quot; without having to pay the GST/HST.</p>
<p>It does not include goods or software added to <a href="#capital">capital property</a> you own or to any of your property that is not for sale.</p>
<h2><a name="alcoholicbeverages" id="alcoholicbeverages"></a>Alcoholic beverages</h2>
<p>For&nbsp;purposes of the first nations tax,&nbsp;alcoholic beverages includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>beer, ale, stout, porter, or malt liquor containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume</li>
<li>wine containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume</li>
<li>any beverage containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume that is obtained from the distillation of grains, fruit, or other agricultural products or from the distillation of beer or wine</li>
<li>any beverage that is a combination of the above beverages, which is suitable for human consumption, and that contains more than&nbsp;0.5% alcohol by volume</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, when we refer to alcohol, we mean ethyl alcohol.</p>
<h2><a name="allinclusive" id="allinclusive"></a>All-inclusive price</h2>
<p>Generally, an all-inclusive price means a single price for all <a href="#property">property</a> and <a href="#services">services</a> sold together in a package. However, in the tourism industry, sometimes prices for certain property or services are listed on an invoice for information purposes. We would accept that such packages are sold for an <span class="nowrap">all-inclusive price</span>.</p>
<h2><a name="allowance" id="allowance"></a>Allowance</h2>
<p>An allowance means any payment, periodic or otherwise, which you as a member of a <a href="#partnership">partnership</a> receive from the partnership, in addition to your partnership income, without having to account for its use. A reasonable allowance is not included in your income for income tax purposes. For example, you usually do not include an allowance for a motor vehicle in your income when it is based solely on a reasonable per-kilometre rate.</p>
<h2><a name="ancillary" id="ancillary"></a>Ancillary supply (for purposes of&nbsp;the public service bodies' rebate)</h2>
<p>An &quot;ancillary supply&quot; means an exempt supply of property or a service for which an amount (other than a nominal amount) is paid or payable to the supplier as medical funding. Also, to be an ancillary supply, <strong>one</strong> of the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The payment is for a service of organizing or coordinating the making of facility supplies or home medical supplies.</li>
<li>The payment is for the part of property or a service (other than a financial service) used to make a facility supply. However, the supply cannot be a home medical supply or a facility supply itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of supplies that could be ancillary supplies are laboratory and diagnostic services, centralized laundry services, and in-patient meal services.</p>
<h2><a name="armslength" id="armslength"></a>Arm’s length</h2>
<p>Arm's length generally refers to a relationship or a transaction between persons acting in their separate interests. An arm’s length transaction is generally a transaction that reflects ordinary commercial dealings between parties acting in their own interests.</p>
<p>&quot;Related persons&quot; are not considered to deal with each other at arm’s length. For example, individuals connected by blood relationship, marriage or <span class="nowrap">common-law</span> partnership, or adoption, are related persons. A corporation and another person or two corporations may also be related persons. Also, for purposes of the GST/HST, a member of a partnership is related to the partnership.</p>
<p>&quot;Unrelated persons&quot; may not be dealing with each other at&nbsp;arm’s length at a particular time. Each case will depend upon its own facts. The following factors are useful criteria that will be considered in determining whether parties are not dealing at arm’s length:</p>
<ol>
<li>the existence of a common mind which directs the&nbsp;bargaining for both parties to a transaction</li>
<li>the parties to a transaction are &quot;acting in concert&quot; without separate interests; &quot;acting in concert&quot; means, for example, a group acting with considerable interdependence in transactions involving a common purpose</li>
<li>the existence of control of one party by the other by way of, for example, advantage, authority, or influence</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/series-1-individuals/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">Income Tax Folio&nbsp;S1‑F5‑C1, Related persons and dealing at arm's length</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="associate" id="associate"></a>Associate</h2>
<p>For <a href="#gst">GST/HST</a> purposes, an associate is generally used to describe a relationship between <a href="#person">persons</a> where one controls the other. An association may exist between:</p>
<ul>
<li>two or more <a href="#corporation">corporations</a></li>
<li>an individual and a corporation</li>
<li>a person and a <a href="#partnership">partnership</a> or trust</li>
<li>two persons, if they are associated with the same third person</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="entity" id="entity"></a>Band-empowered entity</h2>
<p>A band-empowered entity is a <a href="#corporation">corporation</a>, board, council, association, society, or other organization that is <strong>owned</strong> or <strong>controlled</strong> by a <a href="#band">band</a>, a <a href="#tribal">tribal council</a>, or a group of bands other than a tribal council. This policy is applicable to those band-empowered entities situated on a <a href="#reserve">reserve</a>. A band-empowered entity is considered to be situated on a reserve when the entity maintains a presence on reserve.</p>
<p>An entity is considered to be <strong>owned</strong> by a band, a tribal council, or a group of bands other than a tribal council if one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the band, tribal council, or group of bands owns all or substantially all (90%) of the shares or holds all or substantially all of the memberships of the entity</li>
<li>the band, tribal council, or group of bands holds title to the assets of the entity or controls its disposition, such that in the event of wind up or liquidation, these assets are vested in the band.</li>
</ul>
<p>An entity is considered to be <strong>controlled</strong> by the band, tribal council, or group or bands if all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the band, tribal council, group of bands, or individual members of the band, tribal council, or group of bands appoint or elect a majority of the members of the governing body of the entity (for example, directors)</li>
<li>the entity is required by legislation, by-laws, or an operating agreement, to submit to the band, tribal council, or group of bands, its operating budget and where applicable, its capital budget for review and approval</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="management" id="management"></a>Band management activities</h2>
<p>Band management activities are activities or programs undertaken by a <a href="#band">band</a> or <a href="#entity">band-empowered entity</a> that are not <a href="#commercial">commercial activities</a> for which they would otherwise be entitled to an <a href="#itc">input tax credit</a> (ITC). In determining whether the acquisition of a <a href="#supply">supply</a> is for band management, the output of the activity or program will be the determining factor, as opposed to the objectives of the activity or program. For example, a band's objective&nbsp;of a&nbsp;program may be to provide employment and training to band members. To achieve this objective, the band may form a commercial enterprise which will provide on-the-job training and also create employment. Although the band's objective is to train persons, the output is a commercial activity for which there is an entitlement to ITCs. As a result, supplies acquired for use in this band program are not considered to have been acquired for use in band management activities.</p>
<h2><a name="bank" id="bank"></a>Bank</h2>
<p>Bank, in respect of a fiscal year, means a bank or an authorized foreign bank within the meaning of section 2 of the <em>Bank Act</em>; but does not include an insurer.</p>
<h2><a name="basic" id="basic"></a>Basic service</h2>
<p>Basic service means a type of service that could be performed in a customs bonded warehouse. You do not have to actually perform the service in a customs bonded warehouse, but you should be able to perform it on the goods in their present stage of processing, and in a customs bonded warehouse. Basic services include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>disassembling or reassembling the goods if they have been assembled or disassembled for packing, handling, or transport</li>
<li>displaying, inspecting, labelling, packing, storing, or testing the goods</li>
<li>removing a sample of the goods for soliciting orders</li>
<li>cleaning, diluting, normal maintenance and servicing, preserving, separating defective goods from prime quality goods, sorting or grading, trimming, filing, slitting, cutting, or complying with any applicable law of Canada or a province or territory, as long as the characteristics of the goods are not materially altered</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="basic" id="basic"></a>Basic tax content</h2>
<p>Basic tax content of a <a href="#property">property</a> generally means the amount of the <a href="#gst">GST/HST</a> that was payable for your last acquisition of the property, and for any <a href="#improvement">improvements</a>&nbsp;you made to the property since that last acquisition, less any amounts that you were, or would have been, entitled to recover (for example, by rebate or remission, but not by&nbsp;<a href="#itc">input tax credits</a>). The calculation for the basic tax content also takes into account any depreciation in the value of the property since you last acquired it (for example, when you purchased it or were last considered to have purchased it).</p>
<p>You may have to calculate the basic tax content of a property if you are a registrant and you increase or decrease your use of the property in your commercial activities.</p>
<p><strong>Basic tax content formula:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(A - B)&nbsp;<span>×</span> C</strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> is the GST/HST payable for your last acquisition of the property and for later improvements you made to the property.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> is any rebate or refund of GST/HST you were entitled to claim or would have been entitled to claim if you had not been entitled to claim an input tax credit (ITC) for the GST/HST payable for your last acquisition of the property and for later improvements you made to it, but not including ITCs you were entitled to claim. For charities, this amount usually equals 50% of the amount in &quot;A&quot; above.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>the fair market value of the property at the time of the change-in-use <strong>divided</strong> by the total <strong>cost</strong> (not including the GST/HST) for your last acquisition of the property and for subsequent improvements you made to it</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="builder" id="builder"></a>Builder</h2>
<p>Builder, for the purposes of GST/HST rebates, generally includes a <a href="#person">person</a> who is in the business of constructing or <a href="#substantialrenovation">substantially renovating</a> <a href="#house">houses</a>&nbsp;for sale. The house may be on land owned or leased by that builder. The term &quot;builder&quot; may also include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a manufacturer or vendor of a new <a href="#mobile">mobile home</a> or <a href="#floating">floating home</a></li>
<li>a person who buys an unoccupied new house for resale</li>
<li>a person who acquires an interest in a house while the house is under construction or substantial renovation, and completes or engages another person to complete the construction or substantial renovation</li>
<li>a person who has converted a non-residential property into a house without substantially renovating the property</li>
</ul>
<p>A person you hire to provide construction services on land you lease or own, and that does not have an interest in that land, is not generally considered to be a builder. For example, a contractor you hire to build your new house, or to substantially renovate your existing house, on land you own is not considered to be the builder.</p>
<h2><a name="business" id="business"></a>Business</h2>
<p>A business may include a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind, whether or not the activity or undertaking is performed for profit. It also includes any activity done on a regular and continuous basis that involves providing of <a href="#property">property</a> by way of lease, licence or similar arrangement, but does not include an office or employment.</p>
<h2><a name="quarter" id="quarter"></a>Calendar quarter</h2>
<p>A calendar quarter means a period of three months <span>beginning on the&nbsp;first day of January, April, July, or October in each calendar year</span>.</p>
<h2><a name="calendaryear" id="calendaryear"></a>Calendar year</h2>
<p>Calendar year&nbsp;means a year that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.</p>
<h2><a name="camping" id="camping"></a>Camping accommodation</h2>
<p>Camping accommodation means a campsite at a campground or recreational trailer park in Canada that is rented continuously as a place of lodging for periods of <strong>less</strong> than one month for the same individual. It includes water, electricity, and waste disposal services if provided with the campsite and accessed by an outlet or hookup at the campsite.</p>
<h2><a name="canadianpartnership" id="canadianpartnership"></a>Canadian partnership</h2>
<p>Canadian partnership means a <a href="#partnership">partnership</a> each member of which is a <a href="#corporation">corporation</a> or a <a href="#partnership">partnership</a> and is resident in Canada.</p>
<h2><a name="rights" id="rights"></a>Canadian rights</h2>
<p>The Canadian rights for <a href="#intangible">intangible personal property</a>&nbsp;means that part of the property that can be used in Canada.</p>
<h2><a name="capitalpersonalproperty" id="capitalpersonalproperty"></a>Capital personal property</h2>
<p>A capital personal property includes depreciable <a href="#property">property</a> that is eligible or would be eligible for a capital cost allowance for income tax purposes. It also includes any personal property, except depreciable property, the sale of which would&nbsp;result in&nbsp;a capital gain or loss for income tax purposes. For <a href="#gst">GST/HST</a> purposes, capital personal property does not include property in Classes 12, 14, or 44 of Schedule II to the <em>Income Tax Regulations</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="carrier" id="carrier"></a>Carrier</h2>
<p>Carrier means a <a href="#person">person</a> who supplies <a href="#freight">freight transportation services</a>, whether that person actually performs the services or not. A person needs only to accept responsibility as the <a href="#supplier">supplier</a> of the freight transportation service to be considered the carrier.</p>

        <p>A person who has a contract with a <a href="#shipper">shipper</a> to move the shipper's goods from one place to another is still considered to be a carrier of the goods, even if the work is subcontracted to another person who actually performs the entire freight transportation service.</p>

For <a href="#gst">GST/HST</a> purposes, a person cannot be both a shipper and a carrier for the same shipment; the person is considered a shipper only. A shipper does not include a carrier.</p>
<h2><a name="shippersdeclaration" id="shippersdeclaration"></a>Shipper's declaration</h2>
<p>The shipper's declaration should state that the goods are being shipped for export and the carrier's freight transportation services are part of a continuous outbound freight movement of the goods. The declaration could be on the bill of lading given to the original carrier, or on a separate document given to the carrier.</p>
<p>If the declaration is not made, the carrier's services are taxable at <span class="nowrap">5%</span>, 12%, 13%, 14%, or 15% and the carrier has to collect the GST/HST on the freight transportation services provided in Canada, unless interlining applies (see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/specific-sectors/gst-hst-specific-situations/gst-hst-information-freight-carriers.html#interlining">If the freight transportation service has an interlining agreement</a>).</p>
<p>A carrier's services are also taxable at 5%, 12%, 13%, 14%, or 15% if a shipper provides a declaration to the carrier but the goods are not exported. In this case, the carrier is not required to collect the GST/HST on its services if the carrier did not know or could not reasonably have known that the goods were being delivered to a destination in Canada. When the shipper provides a false declaration, the shipper has to account for the tax on the carrier's services.</p>
<p><strong>Whether you receive qualifying funding is important in determining if you are a facility operator for all or any part of a fiscal year.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you operate a facility and you receive qualifying funding for an entire fiscal year, that funding is considered qualifying funding for the whole year if all the conditions are met. This would mean that you are a facility operator for the whole year.</p>
<p>If, however, you operate a facility and you receive qualifying funding for only a part of a fiscal year, that funding is considered qualifying funding for that particular part of the fiscal year if all the conditions are met. This would mean that you are a facility operator for that part of the year.</p>

<p>A short-term accommodation means the rental of an accommodation unit in Canada as a place of lodging for an individual who will occupy it continuously for a period of <strong>less </strong>than one month and that costs more than <strong>$20</strong> per night. For example, overnight or weeklong accommodation in any of the following would usually be considered short-term accommodation:</p>

For purposes of the new residential rental property rebate, reference to a single unit residential complex includes a <a href="#complex">residential complex</a> containing not more than two residential units (for example, a duplex).</p>
<p>A single unit residential complex generally includes other structures near or adjacent to the unit, such as detached garages or sheds. It also includes the land subjacent and immediately contiguous to the unit that can reasonably be regarded as contributing to the use and enjoyment of the unit as a place of residence. We consider that up to half a hectare (1.23 acres) of land may be reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of a unit.

<h2><a name="substantialrenovation" id="substantialrenovation"></a>Substantial renovation (for&nbsp;purposes of the new housing rebates)</h2>
<p>Major changes have to be made to meet the definition of a substantial renovation. In a major renovation project, the interior of a building is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of the existing housing has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (90% test).</p>
<p>You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test.</p>
<p>Only livable areas count towards a substantial renovation including finished basements and finished attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test.</p>
