        <h4 id="general">Sale of goods</h4>
<p>There is no change to the current place of supply rules for supplies of goods by way of sale. A supply by way of sale of goods is deemed to be made in a province if the supplier delivers the property or makes it available in the province to the recipient of the supply.</p>
<p>The application of this place of supply rule is generally based on the province in which legal delivery of the goods to the recipient occurs. However, for purposes of the rule, property is also deemed to be delivered in a particular province, and not in any other province, if the supplier <strong>either</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">ships the property to a destination in the particular province that is specified in the contract for carriage of the property or transfers possession of the property to a common <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#carrier">carrier</a> or consignee that the supplier has retained on behalf of the recipient to ship the property to such a destination</li>
<li class="bullet">sends the property by mail or courier to an address in the particular province</li>

  </header>
  <div class="modal-body">
   <p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
   <p>A bank orders cheques to be shipped by the supplier directly to all its branches situated across Canada. HST applies to the supply of cheques that are shipped to the branches of the bank that are situated in the participating provinces. GST applies to the supply of cheques that are shipped to the branches of the bank that are situated in the non-participating provinces.</p>
   <p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
   <p>A store in Ontario agrees to sell goods to a purchaser in Prince Edward Island (PEI). Based on the terms of delivery in the agreement for the sale of the goods, legal delivery of the goods to the purchaser occurs in PEI. Because legal delivery of the goods to the purchaser occurs in PEI, the supply of the good is made in that province and subject to HST at a rate of 14%.</p>
   <p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
   <p>A store in Alberta agrees to sell goods to a purchaser in Ontario. Based on the terms of delivery in the agreement for the sale of the goods, legal delivery of the goods to the purchaser occurs in Alberta. However, the supplier agrees to have the goods shipped to the purchaser in Ontario. Although legal delivery of the goods to the purchaser occurs in Alberta, delivery of the goods to the purchaser is considered to occur in Ontario because the supplier ships the goods to an address in Ontario. The supply of the goods is therefore made in Ontario and HST will apply.</p>
   <p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
   <p>A supplier in Nova Scotia makes a supply by way of sale of a good to an Ontario company. Based on the terms of delivery for the sale of the good, legal delivery of the good to the purchaser occurs in Nova Scotia. The supplier sends the good by courier to an address outside Canada. Although the supply of the good is made in Nova Scotia, the supply of the good is zero-rated as an export because the supplier sends the good by courier to an address outside Canada.</p>

<p>A recipient of a supply by way of lease, license or similar arrangement that exercises an option to purchase the good under the arrangement is for greater certainty considered to take delivery of the good supplied by way of sale at the place and time where the recipient ceases to have possession of the good as a lessee and begins to have possession of the good as a purchaser. </p>
<p>In this case, the place of supply will be based on the place where the recipient begins to have possession of the good as a purchaser rather than the place where the recipient first obtained possession of the good as a lessee.</p>

        <summary>Rentals and leases-more than three months</summary>




        <h4 id="rentalsmore">Rentals and leases-more than three months</h4>
<p>For GST/HST purposes, where a supply of property is made by way of lease, license or similar arrangement for an amount that is attributable to a period (referred to as a &quot;lease interval&quot;) that is the whole or a part of the period during which possession or use of the property is provided under the arrangement, a separate supply of the property for a separate amount is deemed to be made by the supplier and received by the recipient for each lease interval.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the supply for each lease interval is deemed to be made on the earliest of the first day of the lease interval, the day on which the lease payment attributable to that interval becomes due and the day that payment is made.</p>
<p>A supply of goods (other than a specified motor vehicle) by way of lease, license or similar arrangement for more than three months is deemed to be made in a province if the ordinary location of the property, as determined at the time the supply is made is in the province. A separate supply of the property is deemed to be made for each lease interval on the earliest of the following days:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">the first day of the lease interval</li>
<li class="bullet">the day on which the lease payment attributable to that interval becomes due</li>
<li class="bullet">the day that payment is made</li>
</ul>
<p>For purposes of the place of supply rules, the ordinary location of property is deemed to be the location where the supplier and the recipient mutually agree that the ordinary location of the property is to be at a particular point in time. In other words, the mutual agreement of the supplier and recipient will be determinative even where the property is actually located at a different place at the relevant time than what had been agreed upon. The mutual agreement of the parties may change from time to time. Therefore, even if the original written agreement for a supply of property specified that the property will be located in a particular province, the parties may mutually agree subsequent to the signing of the contract that the property is to be moved at a particular time to a location in another province in which case the latter location will be the ordinary location of the property at that particular time.</p>

        <h4>Supply of real property partly in a province</h4>
<p>To determine whether the HST applies to a taxable supply of real property and at what rate, we have to determine where the real property is situated. The part of the real property that is situated in the particular province, and the part of the real property that is situated in the other province or outside Canada, are each considered to be a separate taxable supply made for a separate amount equal to the portion of the total amount for all the property that is reasonably attributable for each part of the real property. As a result, it is only the part of the real property that is situated in the participating provinces that will be subject to HST.</p>
<p>Under the place of supply rules that determine whether a supply is made in a province, a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#floating">floating home</a> and a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#mobile">mobile home</a> that is not affixed to land are each considered to be a good and not real property.

        <h4>Lease intervals – Deemed supplies of real property</h4>
<p>Where a supply of property is made by way of lease, license or similar arrangement for consideration that is attributable to a period (referred to as a &quot;lease interval&quot;) that is the whole or a part of the period during which possession or use of the property is provided under the arrangement, a separate supply of the property for separate consideration is deemed to be made by the supplier and received by the recipient for each lease interval. The supply for each lease interval is deemed to be made on the earliest of:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">the first day of the lease interval</li>
<li class="bullet">the day on which the lease payment attributable to that interval becomes due</li>
<li class="bullet">the day that payment is made</li>

        <h4 id="rule2ipp">Rule 2</h4>
<p>If the Canadian rights for a supply of IPP can only be used primarily (more than 50%) in the participating provinces, the supply is made in a participating province if an equal or greater proportion of the Canadian rights cannot be used in another participating province.</p>
<p>This rule is intended to apply where the Canadian rights can only be used primarily (more than 50%) in the participating provinces and the province in which the greatest proportion of those rights can be used can be determined because the use of at least some of those rights is specifically limited to one or more of those provinces.</p>
<p>This rule therefore does not apply if the use of the rights is not specifically limited to one or more of the participating provinces, which will be the case, for example, if the rights can be used on an unlimited basis in more than one of those provinces or if the province in which the greatest proportion of the Canadian rights can be used cannot be determined.</p>

        <h4 id="rule3ipp">Rule 3</h4>
<p>If Rule 1 and 2 do not apply, the supply is made in a given province under the following conditions:</p>
<h5>Consideration of $300 or less</h5>
<p>If the value of the consideration for the supply of the IPP is $300 or less, the supply is made in a province if:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">the supply is made through a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#permanent">permanent establishment</a> of the supplier located in the province in the presence of an individual who is the recipient, or through a vending machine situated in the province</li>
<li class="bullet">the IPP can be used in the province</li>
</ul>
<h5>Address in Canada obtained</h5>
<p>If the preceding rule does not deem the supply to be made in a province, the supply may be deemed to be made in a participating province if the supplier obtains an address of the recipient in the province in the normal course of business and if the IPP can be used in the province. The address can be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">a home or a business address in Canada of the recipient</li>
<li class="bullet">if more than one such address is obtained, the home or business address in Canada of the recipient that is most closely connected with the supply</li>

<h5>Highest tax rate</h5>
<p>If the preceding rules do not deem the supply to be made in a province, the supply is made in the participating province for which the tax rate is the highest among the provinces in which the property can be used.</p>

<p>However, the supply of a customs brokerage service for imported non-commercial goods is made in a participating province if the provincial part of the HST is imposed on the importation of the goods at the rate for the participating province or will be imposed if various provisions did not apply to relieve certain types of importations from the imposition of the provincial part of the HST.</p>
<p>Relieving provisions apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">imported goods accounted for as commercial goods, imported specified motor vehicles or imported <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#mobile">mobile homes</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#floating">floating homes</a> that have been used or occupied in Canada by any individual</li>
<li class="bullet">certain goods imported by or on behalf of persons who are resident in the Nova Scotia offshore area or the Newfoundland offshore area</li>
<li class="bullet">imported goods that qualify as non-taxable importations from the imposition of the GST or federal part of the HST</li>
</ul>
<p>In any other case, the supply of the customs brokerage service is made in a non-participating province.</p>
<p>The above rules do not apply to the supply of any service provided in relation to an objection, appeal, re-determination, re-appraisal, review, refund, abatement, remission or drawback, or in relation to a request for any of the foregoing.</p>

<p>The supply of a mail delivery service for which the postage stamp or similar item is used as evidence of the payment of postage for the mail delivery service is made in the province in which the stamp or item is delivered. However, this rule does not apply in circumstances where:</p>
<ul>

<li class="bullet">the amount for the supply of the service is $5 or more and the address to which the mail is sent is not in a participating province</li>

<p>In both of these circumstances, the place of supply rules as explained in freight transportation services determines the place of supply of the mail delivery service.

   <p>A Canadian charity headquartered in Moncton, New Brunswick, raises funds by seeking donations through direct mail solicitations. To facilitate the receipt of these donations, the charity enters into a Business Reply Mail Agreement with Canada Post for the use of a domestic business reply indicia on return address envelopes that accompany the charitable solicitations. Under the Agreement, the charity uses the address of its headquarters in Moncton as its unique business return address on the business reply envelopes. The charity pays an annual registration fee for the right to use a business reply indicia with its Moncton address, and a fee for the mail delivery service that is charged on a per returned envelope basis.</p>
   <p>The supply of the mail delivery service for which there is a per returned envelope charge is made in New Brunswick. As a result, the HST will apply at the rate 13% based on the fact that the destination of the returned business reply envelopes is the address of the charity in Moncton, New Brunswick. The supply of the right to use a business reply indicia for its Moncton address is considered to be a supply of IPP that relates to a mail delivery service. Therefore, the supply of the right to use a business reply indicia in this circumstance is considered to be made in New Brunswick.

<p>For purposes of the place of supply rules that determine the province in which a supply of a telecommunication service is made, the <strong>billing location</strong> for a telecommunication service is in a province if the fee for the service is charged or applied to an account that the recipient has with the supplier of the service and the account relates to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/definitions-gst-hst.html#facility">telecommunications facilities</a> that are used or are available for use by the recipient to obtain telecommunication services and all of those facilities are ordinarily located in the province. Where, from time to time, the supplier and the recipient mutually agree upon the ordinary location of the telecommunications facilities at a particular time, that location is considered to be the ordinary location of the telecommunication facilities at the particular time.</p>
<p>If the fee for the service is not charged or applied to an account that the recipient has with the supplier of the telecommunication service, the billing location is considered to be in a province if the telecommunications facility used to initiate the service is located in that province.</p>

<li class="bullet">all of the facilities are ordinarily located in that province</li>
<li class="bullet">where not all of the facilities are ordinarily located in the province, the invoice for the supply is sent to an address in that province</li>

<p>For other types of supplies of telecommunication services (other than a service of granting sole access to a telecommunications channel), the supply is made in a province if the telecommunication:</p>

        <h3 id="motorvehicles">Motor vehicles</h3>
<p>For motor vehicles that require registration under the laws of a participating province, the tax is payable to the Receiver General, but collected by the provincial licensing authorities on the <strong>earlier</strong> of:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">the day you register the vehicle in the participating province</li>
<li class="bullet">the day on or before which you have to register the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>A specified motor vehicle is defined to mean a vehicle that is, or that would be, if it were imported, classified under several tariff items in Schedule I to the Customs Tariff. Generally, this includes almost all motor vehicles, other than racing cars classified under heading number 87.03, and any prescribed motor vehicles.</p>
