					<h1 id="readguidance">Steps to take to make government websites more secure</h1>
					<p>Those managing government websites should complete the following steps to become compliant with the Government of Canada's web security standards.</p>
					<p> This guidance supplements the Information technology policy implementation notice (ITPIN): <br />
						<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/information-technology/policy-implementation-notices/implementing-https-secure-web-connections-itpin.html">Implementing HTTPS for Secure Web Connections</a>


					<ol class="lst-spcd">

						 <li> <b>Identify key resources</b> required to act as central point(s) of contact with TBS and the HTTPS Community of Practice.  Establish connections via the GCTools channels at:

										 <ul>
											 <li>GCcollab: <a href="https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/1358152/engc-https-everywhere-2018frgc-https-partout-2018" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">HTTPS Everywhere 2018</a></li>
											 <li>GCmessage: <a href="https://message.gccollab.ca/channel/httpseverywhere-httpspartout" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">#HTTPSEverywhere-HTTPSpartout</a></li>
										 </ul>
						 </li>

						 <li><b>Perform an inventory</b> of all departmental domains and subdomains. Sources of information include:

							<ul>

									<li>Internally available <a href="https://https-everywhere.canada.ca/" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">HTTPS Dashboard</a></li>
									<li>TBS Application Portfolio Management (APM)</li>
									<li>Departmental business units </li>
						 </ul>

						 </li>

						 <li><b>Provide an up-to-date list</b> of all domain and sub-domains of the publicly-accessible websites and web services to TBS Cybersecurity.
								 <ul>
										 <li>Update and send the filtered "compliance.csv" file available from the HTTPS Dashboard for mass update; or</li>
										 <li>use the following website for domain additions: <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/pages/submit-institutional-domains.html" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Submit your institution's domains</a></li>

								 </ul>

						 </li>
						 <li><b>Perform an assessment</b> of the domains and sub-domains to determine the status of the configuration. Tools available to support this activity includes GC HTTPS Dashboard, SSL Labs, Hardenize, SSLShopper, etc.</li>

						 <li><b>Develop a prioritized implementation schedule</b> for each of the affected websites and web services, following the recommended prioritization approach in the ITPIN:

							<ul>

									<li>6.2.1 Newly developed websites and web services must adhere to this ITPIN upon launch. </li>
									<li>6.2.2 Websites and web services that involve an exchange of personal information or other sensitive information must receive priority following a risk-based approach, and migrate as soon as possible. </li>
									<li>6.2.3 All remaining websites and web services must be accessible through a secure connection, as outlined in Section 6.1, by December 31, 2019.</li>
						 </ul>

						 </li>
						 <li><b>Engage departmental IT planning groups</b> for implementation as appropriate.
							<ul>

									<li>Where necessary adjust IT Plans and budget estimates for the FY where work is expected.</li>
									<li>It is recommended that SSC partners contact their SSC Service Delivery Manager to discuss the departmental action plan and required steps to submit a request for change. </li>
						 </ul>

						 </li>

						 <li>Based on the assessment, and using the <a href="https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/1358152/engc-https-everywhere-2018frgc-https-partout-2018" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">guidance available on GCcollab</a>, the following activities may be required:
							<ul>

									<li><b>Obtain certificates</b> from a GC-approved certificate source as outlined in the Recommendations for TLS Server Certificates for GC Public Facing Web Services</li>
									<li><b>Obtain the configuration guidance</b> for the appropriate endpoints (for example, a web server, network/security appliances, etc.) and implement recommended configurations to support HTTPS.</li>
						 </ul>

						 </li>

						 <li><b>Perform another assessment</b> of the applicable domains and sub-domains to confirm that the configuration has been updated and that HTTPS is enforced in accordance with the ITPIN. Results will
								 appear in the HTTPS Dashboard within 24 hours.


						 </li>
