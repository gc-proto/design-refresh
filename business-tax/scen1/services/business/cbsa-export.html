      <h2 id="report">As an exporter, you have to report your goods</h2>

      <p>Goods being exported from Canada are required by the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52.6/">Customs Act</a> to be reported. The three main objectives of export reporting are to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Control the export of <a href="/export/ndr-adr-eng.html">restricted</a> (i.e. regulated, controlled, or prohibited) goods;</li>
        <li>Collect accurate information on Canadian exports; and,</li>
        <li>Control the outbound movement of goods in transit through Canada.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Canada has a responsibility to ensure that goods entering the international market from this country do not pose a security threat to other countries. </p>
      <p>The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) export program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports the Government of Canada's evolving national and international priorities;</li>
        <li>Ensures that exporters understand and follow national export-related laws, regulations, policies, processes, and procedures; and,</li>
        <li>Aids in maintaining Canada's trade reputation by ensuring that our exports comply with international agreements and conventions and protects Canada's national interest (i.e. our exports do not cause harm to Canada or its allies, and are not used
          for criminal activities).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="whoexport">Who is the exporter?</h2>

      <p>The exporter is the party responsible for causing the goods to be exported and the holder of the <a href="../taxes/business-number.html">business number (BN)</a>. The identities and the responsibilities of parties
        involved in the sale/purchase/export transaction should clearly be identified. This should not be confused with the carriers, customs service providers, or other parties involved in the transportation arrangements.</p>

      <p>The exporter, who can be a <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/nnrsdnts/ndvdls/nnrs-eng.html">non-resident</a>, is responsible for completing the export declaration and submitting it to the CBSA.&nbsp; The exporter may delegate this to a third
        party such as a customs service provider. When a third party prepares the export declaration on the exporter's behalf, the exporter of record (whose name and BN are on the export declaration) remains liable for ensuring that true and accurate
        information is provided to the CBSA within the required time frames.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>Any penalties resulting from submitting an incomplete, inaccurate, or late export declaration will be assessed against the owner of the BN, listed as the exporter of record.</p>
      </div>

      <p>For more information, refer to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2005-23/">Reporting of Exported Goods Regulations</a> and the "Who Must Report Goods for Export?" section of <a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-1-eng.html">Memorandum D20-1-1, Export Reporting</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="h5">Preparing to export</h3></summary>
        <h4>Obtain a Business Number</h4>
        <p> Before exporting commercial goods from Canada, as a business or an individual, you will need to obtain a business number (BN) issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for an import/export account. This account is free of charge and can usually
          be set-up in a matter of minutes.</p>
        <p>To register for a BN or add an import/export RM account identifier to an existing BN:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s Business Window at 1-800-959-5525</li>
          <li>Visit the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>'s <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/bn-ne/bro-ide/menu-eng.html">Business Registration Online (BRO)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Identify the goods you want to export</h4>
        <p>You must provide true and accurate information and a complete description of the goods you plan to export before proceeding. An accurate description will assist in determining if your goods are restricted (i.e. regulated, controlled, or prohibited)
          and/or if a permit or license is required. </p>
        <h4>Determine the country of origin for the goods you are exporting</h4>
        <p> The origin of goods to be exported can affect permit requirements. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An Individual Export Permit is required for United States origin goods exported to certain countries and countries on the Area Control List. For a list of these countries, please consult the <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/about-a_propos/expor/before-avant.aspx?lang=eng">Global Affairs Canada</a>            Web site. </li>
          <li>A General Export Permit is required to export United States origin goods with a value of CAN$2,000 or more to all other destinations.</li>
          <li>A permit is not required to export United States origin goods back to the United States. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refer to <a href="/publications/dm-md/d11-eng.html">Memoranda Series&nbsp;D11, General Tariff Information</a> for additional information on origin.</p>
        <h4>Ensure the goods are permitted to be exported from Canada</h4>
        <p> Certain goods cannot be exported from Canada. A few examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drugs and narcotics controlled under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (refer to <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-4.html#docCont">section&nbsp;6</a>).</li>
          <li>Black bear claws, gall bladder and paws. Learn more from the <a href="http://www.cites.org/">Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species and Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)</a>.</li>
          <li>Counterfeit money. Please see the Criminal Code of Canada, <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-211.html#h-128http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-208.html">section 460</a>, Advertising and Trafficking in Counterfeit
            Money or Counterfeit Tokens of Value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More information about <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/index.aspx?lang=eng">export controls</a> can be found on the <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/about-a_propos/expor/before-avant.aspx?lang=eng">Global Affairs Canada</a>          Web site. </p>
        <h4>Determine whether the goods you intend to export are subject to any permits, restrictions or regulations by the CBSA or other government departments</h4>
        <p> The CBSA is responsible for administering certain export requirements on behalf of other government departments. Permits, certificates or licenses may be required when exporting certain goods from Canada. The CBSA's <a href="/export/reflist-listeref-eng.html">Other Government Department and Agencies: Reference List for Exporters</a>          can help you identify the appropriate department or agency for permit enquiries, if applicable.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>It is the exporter's responsibility to ensure that the goods meet all requirements under the law. Failure to do so could result in fines, detention and/or seizure of the goods by the CBSA.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A list of other government department requirements can be found in <a href="/publications/dm-md/d19-eng.html">Memoranda Series D19, Acts and Regulations of Other Government Departments</a>.</p>
        <h4>Ensure that the goods you are exporting are allowed entry into the destination country</h4>
        <p> It is in your best interest to verify that your goods meet the import requirements of the receiving country. For information about the requirements of other countries, refer to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.wcoomd.org/">World Customs Organization</a>; or, </li>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx">embassy or consulate</a> (in Canada) of the country to which you will be exporting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also have the importer of your goods contact their local government to ensure the goods comply with their import regulations. </p>

          nearest to the place of export. </p>
        <p>Even if you are exporting restricted goods to the U.S. that are exempt from export reporting requirements, you are still required to present your permit, certificate, or license to the CBSA at the <a href="/do-rb/services/export-eng.html">Designated Export Office</a>          located nearest to the place of export.</p>
        <p>Goods transiting through the U.S. to a subsequent international destination must be reported on an <a href="/publications/forms-formulaires/b13a-eng.html">export declaration</a>. Because the ultimate destination of the goods is a country other
          than the U.S., they must be reported if their value is CAN$2,000 or more, or any value if the goods are restricted. In addition, any goods entering the U.S. on a transportation and exportation entry (T&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;E) bond (i.e. in transit)
          require an export declaration.</p>

          <h3 class="h5">Classifying your exports</h3></summary>
        <h4>If you require an export declaration, determine the appropriate export classification code</h4>
        <p> Once you have determined that the goods may be exported and that you need to submit an export declaration, you must classify the goods. Depending on your method of reporting, either the Statistics Canada eight-digit Canadian Export Classification
          number or the ten-digit Canadian Tariff Classification number may be used.</p>
        <p>If you are using CAED to submit your declaration, you must use the eight-digit Canadian Export Classification number. The Canadian Export Classification number is based on an international six-digit 'root' with an additional two digits for Canadian
          domestic purposes for a total of eight digits.</p>
        <p>To obtain the eight-digit Canadian Export Classification number:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consult Canadian Export Classification on <a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?ObjId=65-209-X&amp;ObjType=2&amp;lang=en&amp;Limit=0">Statistics Canada's</a> website. <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To obtain the ten-digit Tariff Classification Number:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consult the <a href="/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/menu-eng.html">Customs Tariff</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on the methodology for classifying goods according to the Customs Tariff, refer to <a href="/publications/dm-md/d10/d10-13-1-eng.html">Memorandum&nbsp; D10-13-1, Classification of Goods</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="h5">Shipping and reporting your goods</h3></summary>
        <h4>Determine your method of shipping and identify the reporting time frame for that method</h4>
        <p>If you are required to report your export to the CBSA, you must do so prior to export and according to specific timeframes depending on the mode of transportation used to export the goods from Canada. The minimum timeframe for reporting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Air – two hours before goods are loaded;</li>
          <li>Highway – prior to export;</li>
          <li>Marine – forty-eight hours before goods are loaded;</li>
          <li>Mail – two hours before goods are brought to the post office; and</li>
          <li>Rail – two hours before goods are loaded.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Determine where to report your goods</h4>
        <p>Non-Restricted Goods are to be reported at a <a href="/do-rb/services/export-eng.html">Designated Export Office</a> located inland or at the border. However, for Restricted Goods, you must present any export permit, license or certificate and
          the export declaration (if required), at the place of exit specified on the permit, license or certificate, <b>before the goods are exported</b>.</p>
        <p>If the permit, license or certificate does not name a place of exit, you must present the permit, license or certificate and the export declaration (if required) to the designated export office located closest to the place of exit.</p>
        <h4>Submit an export declaration if required</h4>
        <p> If you are required to report your exports, you must submit an export declaration by using one of the following methods:</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/exp/index-eng.htm">Canadian Automated Export Declaration (CAED)</a>: An electronic method of reporting exports, which allows you or your agent to quickly prepare your export declarations and transmit the information
          directly to the Government of Canada before exportation. This service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
        <p><a href="/eservices/g7/exporting-eng.html">G7 Electronic Export Declaration Process</a>: This process allows exporters or their agents to file their export declaration using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>
        <p><a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-1-eng.html#_app-b">Summary Reporting</a>: This method is reserved for approved exporters of low-risk bulk or homogenous goods who export on a regular basis and have met specific CBSA requirements. It enables
          you or your agent to summarize required export data, which can be submitted on a monthly basis in writing, after the goods have left Canada. Goods that are controlled, prohibited, or regulated may only be reported via Summary Reporting program
          (SRP) if the exporter has obtained and provided the CBSA with: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Permission to report the restricted goods via SRP from the <a href="/export/reflist-listeref-eng.html">other government department</a> that controls the goods; and,</li>
          <li> All required export permits. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="/publications/forms-formulaires/b13a-eng.html">B13A, Export Declaration</a>: When the use of CAED or G7 EDI is neither feasible nor practical, the exporter can use the Form <a href="/publications/forms-formulaires/b13a-eng.html">B13A, Export Declaration</a>.
          The export declaration must be submitted to a designated export reporting office. If the goods are restricted, the exporter must submit the form to the <a href="/do-rb/services/export-eng.html">Designated Export Office</a> which is indicated
          on the permit or, if no office is indicated, to the office that is closest to the place of exit where the goods will leave Canada.</p>
        <h4>Present proof of export if required</h4>
        <p> In some cases the CBSA requires exporters to produce <a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-4-eng.html">proof of export</a> that the goods have been exported or have been destroyed. For example, this would apply to goods that were initially imported
          into Canada under a temporary importation agreement such as a <a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-4-eng.html">Temporary Admission Permit (form E29B)</a> or the <a href="/trade-commerce/tip-pec-eng.html#a3">ATA Carnet</a> program.</p>
        <h4>Your goods may be examined before export</h4>
        <p><a href="/import/notice-avis-eng.html#cont">Government officials</a> may examine your shipment to ensure compliance with CBSA requirements or other government department regulations. This examination is conducted without charge; however, if there
          is a need to hire a transport company to move or handle your goods, you may receive an invoice from that company for their services.</p>

        <summary>
          <h3 class="h5">After your goods are exported</h3>
        </summary>
        <h4>Provide a Certificate of Origin to the receiver of the goods if requested</h4>
        <p>An importer in the foreign country to which you are exporting goods may be entitled to claim a preferential tariff treatment and pay a lower duty rate if they have a valid certificate of origin (e.g. <a href="/publications/forms-formulaires/b232-eng.html">NAFTA Certificate of Origin</a>).
          The certificate of origin is a signed declaration from the manufacturer of the goods that the goods are of Canadian origin and meet the requirements of a free trade agreement. You, as the exporter, must forward a copy of the certificate of origin
          to the importer and retain a copy for your records.
          <p>For more information on certificates of origin, refer to <a href="/publications/dm-md/d11/d11-4-14-eng.html">Memorandum&nbsp;D11-4-14, Certificate of Origin</a>.</p>
          <h4>Procedures to follow if you need to cancel or amend an export declaration</h4>
          <p> You may have to cancel a shipment or modify information about a shipment you already reported. If so, you must submit an amended declaration to a <a href="/do-rb/menu-eng.html">designated export office</a> clearly identifying the changes. </p>
          <p>There are different procedures depending on the original reporting method:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/exp/index-eng.htm">CAED</a> or <a href="/eservices/g7/exporting-eng.html">G7 EDI Export Reporting</a> – use the amend feature in the program to submit an amended declaration;</li>
            <li><a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-1-eng.html#_app-b">Summary Reporting</a> – notify <a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/subject-sujet/index?lang=eng">Statistics Canada</a>; and </li>
            <li><a href="/publications/forms-formulaires/b13a-eng.html">Form B13A</a> – submit an amended Export Declaration to the designated export reporting office where you presented your original export document.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Voluntary disclosures</h4>
          <p>The voluntary disclosure process encourages clients like yourself to come forward voluntarily to inform the CBSA of any past errors or omissions and make corrections in order to comply with their legal obligations. By offering this opportunity
            to self-correct, you are afforded a greater level of fairness and it may result in penalties being waived.</p>
          <p>For further information on Voluntary Disclosure, refer to <a href="/publications/dm-md/d11/d11-6-4-eng.html">Memorandum D11-6-4, Relief of Interest and/or Penalties Including Voluntary Disclosure</a>.</p>
          <h4>Keep all records pertaining to the export for six years</h4>
          <p> You must keep all records pertaining to your exportations for six years following the exportation of good(s) in either electronic or paper format. For more information on the keeping of books and records pertaining to exports please consult
            <a href="/publications/dm-md/d20/d20-1-5-eng.html">Memorandum&nbsp;D20-1-5, Maintenance of Records and Books in Canada by Exporters and Producers</a>.</p>
          <h4>Make sure you comply with all legislative and regulatory requirements</h4>
          <p> As an exporter, it is in your best interest to be as accurate and as thorough as possible in your export reporting. Proactively seeking guidance from federal departments that control and regulate exports will help you to understand the requirements
            and could help avoid costly delays at the time of export. </p>
          <p>When the CBSA has reasonable grounds to believe that Canada's export laws have been contravened, enforcement actions may be taken, including monetary penalties, the seizure of the goods as forfeit, and the laying of criminal charges.</p>
          <p>The CBSA is committed to working with all its clients to ensure compliance with export legislation and to facilitate exports. </p>
