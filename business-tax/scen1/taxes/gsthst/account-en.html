<p>If you estimate that you will sell or provide taxable property and services in Canada of not more than $100,000 annually and your net tax will be between $3,000 remittable and $3,000 refundable annually,&#160;security&#160;is not required.</p>

<p>The initial amount of the security&#160;is 50% of your estimated net tax, whether positive or negative, during the 12-month period after you register.

<p>Your security&#160;may be in the form of cash, certified cheque, money order, or a qualifying bond. The use of cash or cash equivalents (certified cheque or money order, etc.) may result in the cash being used to pay other outstanding debts to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> at the time the security is released.

<h2 id="needinformation">What information do you need&#160;to register for a GST/HST account?</h2>
<p>When you register, you need to know your&#160;effective date of registration. This date&#160;depends on whether your registration is mandatory or voluntary. For more information, see <a href="#Voluntary">voluntary registration</a>&#160;and <a href="#Mandatory">mandatory registration</a>.</p>

<p>See the following tabs relating to information you have to provide when you register for a GST/HST account.</p>
<div class="wb-tabs">
<div class="tabpanels">
<details id="details-panel1b" open=""><summary>Fiscal year</summary>
<h3>What will be your fiscal year for GST/HST purposes?</h3>
<p>Every registrant has a fiscal year for GST/HST purposes. We use this fiscal year to determine when your GST/HST returns are due. In most cases, your GST/HST fiscal year is the same as your tax year for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>The tax year of the following business entities is usually a calendar year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>individuals and certain trusts</li>
	<li>professional corporations that are members of a partnership (such as a corporation that is the professional practice of an accountant, a lawyer, or a doctor).</li>
</ul>
<p>A calendar year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. If you have a tax year that is the calendar year, your income tax return covers that&#160;period. If your GST/HST fiscal year is the same as your tax year, your GST/HST fiscal year is also the same.</p>
<p>The income tax fiscal period of a partnership, where at least one member of the partnership is an individual, professional corporation, or other affected partnership, is usually a calendar year. If the GST/HST fiscal year is the same as the income tax fiscal period, then it will also be a calendar year.</p>
<p>The GST/HST fiscal year of a corporation is usually the same as its tax year for income tax purposes.</p>
</details>
<details id="details-panel2b"><summary>Reporting periods</summary>
<h3>What will be your reporting period for GST/HST purposes?</h3>
<p>When you register for a GST/HST account, we assign you a reporting period. Your annual<strong> total </strong>revenue&#160;generally determines how many times a year you have to file GST/HST returns. You also have the option to file more frequently by making an election.</p>
