<section>
	<p>Typical situations and the CSS modifications needed to address them. </p>
<h2 class="h4">On this page</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#para">Standard paragraphs</a></li>
	<li><a href="#paralists">Paragraphs with lists</a></li>
	<li><a href="#multilists">Multi-line lists</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(On the page might be better positioned within a div, then you wouldn't have to customize each element (h2 class=h4), and could address all elements at the same time.)</p>

	<h2 id="para">Standard paragraphs</h2>
	<p>The line spacing is slightly larger than typical, but there is evidence to support that it's easier to read this way.</p>
	<p>The problem comes from the spacing between paragraphs not being sufficiently differentiated. If you can't tell if something is a new paragraph or not then it's likely to actually hurt readability. Now I'm just adding more text to so it stretches to an extra line in the paragraph. It's more realistic to have some longer paragraphs here and there, isn't it?</p>
	<p>For those who are self-employed, or who have a spouse or common-law partner who is self-employed, the deadline to file your tax return is June 15, 2019. Since June 15, 2019 is a Saturday, we will consider that you filed your return on time if we receive it, or it is postmarked, no later than June 17, 2019.</p>

	<p>To avoid interest or penalties, make sure you pay any amount you owe by April 30, 2019. After this date, the CRA will charge interest on any amount you owe until your balance is paid.</p>
	<h3>Issues with heading spacing</h3>
	<p>To that end, we need to increase the space between typical paragraphs. We have to account for spacing under headings as well though - if that's less than the line height then it looks incorrect.</p>

	<code>
		p {
			margin-bottom: 1.1em;
		}
		h2, h3, h4 {
			margin-bottom: .7em;
		}

	</code>

</section>

<section>
<h2 id="paralists">Paragraphs with lists</h2>
<p>Pages often have paragraphs with lists mixed in. Short lists can be spaced just like normal lines.</p>
<p>Get everything you need to calculate your income and support any credits, deductions and expenses you’ll claim.</p>
<p>If you were employed or had an investment income in 2018, your employer or financial institution will send you statements commonly referred to as ‘’slips’’. Here are some common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>T3 Statement of Trust Income Allocation and Designations</li>
<li>T4 Statement of Remuneration Paid</li>
<li>T5 Statement of Investment Income</li>
</ul>
<p>Space between the list items is identical to that between normal lines. There's more space before the list than after because the margin is put after the p. So, we need to add a bit of space to the last list item to accommodate it.</p>
<code>
	ul {
		margin-bottom: 1.33em;
	}
</code>
<h2 id="multilists">Multi-line lists</h2>
<p>Short lists work fine, but what if there are multi-line lists? They can seem like they should have more spacing between them. </p>
<ul>
<li>The products marked with (AT) are compatible with Assistive Technology such as Magic and Zoomtext.</li>
<li>The &quot;Services Available&quot; column indicates this certified software product has been approved by the CRA to include new forms/functions provided within this product, such as <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/about-auto-fill-return.html">Auto-fill my return</a> .</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to research the provider's privacy policies before buying or using a software product or web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item in that list is basically a paragraph, but because they're list items, there's as much space between the lines as there is between the bullets. </p>
